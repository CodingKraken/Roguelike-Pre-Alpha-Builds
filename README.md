# Roguelike-Pre-Alpha-Builds
The initial pre-alpha builds of the Roguelike. This includes the source and executables for builds 1 - 3

All of this source code will be depricated for future builds of the Roguelike project. Post-pre-alpha builds will be 
windows programs rather than console based programs, due to the unwieldy nature of the windows console API.

As per the license, you are free to redistribute and edit the source as you like, as long as approriate credit is given.
